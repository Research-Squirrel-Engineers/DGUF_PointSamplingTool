# Software Review for the Software PointSamplingTool


## Software Metadata:

- Name: The name of the software, e.g. *"PointSamplingTool"*.
- Short description: Summary of what the software does, e.g. *"Comprehensive graphical tool for spatial data processing"*.
- Reviewed version: The software version used for the review, e.g. *"3.10.10 LTR"*.
- Platform: (Operating) systems on which the software can be used, e.g. *"Windows, MacOS, Linux, BSD, Android"*.
- Website: URL where further information can be found, e.g. *https://qgis.org*.
- Licensing: Software licence under which the software was published, e.g. *"Open Source with GNU General Public License (GPL)"*.
- Costs: If applicable, regular or one-off licence fees, e.g. *"free of charge"*.
- Input and output formats: The file formats the software can process, e.g. *"geodatabases" (SpatiaLite, PostGIS, MSSQL, ...), "web geodata services" (WMD/WMTS, Vector Tiles, XYZ Tiles, WFS, ...), "geo-vector data formats" (ESRI Shapefile, Geopackage, . ...), "geo-raster data formats" (GeoTIFF, ...), "table data" (CSV, TXT, ...) and other data types* (for QGIS there are an unusually large number of data formats to consider, which would go beyond the scope here).
